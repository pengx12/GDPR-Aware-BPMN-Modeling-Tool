According to Art. 25 GDPR, Data protection by design and by default, it is essential for data controllers to adopt proactive measures to protect personal data throughout the whole lifecycle, especially in the designing phase.

Based on the GDPR, the purpose and types of personal and sensitive data used in data processing should be specified, and one should be able to demonstrate the necessity of collecting said data. Considering the definition and property of the business process, notions of purpose and personal data is introduced in BPMN modeling to identify the necessity of using personal data in software systems.

The goal of the project is to make the modeler aware of the personal data used in business processes in the design phase.

To achieve the goal, the project conducts a literature review on different ontologies to represent BPMN, GDPR and an organizationâ€™s data and choose BPMN Ontology, GDPRtEXT, CSVW and Direct Mapping to represent them respectively. To link the ontologies together, the dissertation creates an ontology to extend them with new classes and properties. As a proof of concept, a GDPR-aware BPMN modeling tool with annotations and notifications referring to the data protection requirements is designed based on the proposed data strategy. Then a case study is presented to evaluate how the strategy works by walking through the GDPR- aware BPMN modeling tool proposed with three use cases: notification of changes, facilitating modelers in determining the necessity of personal data and privacy policy generation. Although the main goal of the dissertation is achieved, there are still some limitations, which are also discussed in the final part of the dissertation
